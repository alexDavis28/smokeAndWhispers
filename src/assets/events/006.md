- Ammo (beyond standard capacity)

- Compulsory Scope Upgrade
- Crash Cushions
- Personal Cloak
- Prescision Targeting Software

These enhancements are experimental gear so do not expect them to function as permanent modifications to your craft. We hope they enable your continued high performance.

Kind Regards, Enver Carlo - Mercenary Liason
